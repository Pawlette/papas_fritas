# Backtracking

## About
A series of problems I've found based on backtracking

### Problem 1: Intersection

Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

#### Example 1

> Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
> Output: [2]

#### Note:
- Each element in the result must be unique.
- The result can be in any order.


### Problem 2: Sort List

Sort a linked list in O(n log n) time using constant space complexity.

#### Example 1

> Input: -1->5->3->4->0
> Output: -1->0->3->4->5
