# Backtracking

## About
A series of problems I've found based on backtracking

### Problem 1: Intersection

Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

### Example 1

> Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
> Output: [2]

#### Note:
- Each element in the result must be unique.
- The result can be in any order.
