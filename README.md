# Papas Fritas
Papas fritas or french fries are my guilty pleasure and I can't stop eat them, same as I can't stop solving puzzles for fun, one after another and so on...

I will solve problems that I found in leetcode and codingame just for fun and to practice computer science concepts

One folder per problem, different approaches to solve the problem
